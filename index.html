<!-- Set up your HTML and write a JavaScript function that will render the contents of the gameboard array to the webpage 
    (for now you can just manually fill in the array with "X"s and "O"s) -->

<!-- Clean up the interface to allow players to put in their names, include a button to start/restart the game and add 
    a display element that congratulates the winning player! -->
